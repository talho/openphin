<p>The Texas PHIN is an online site providing various public health services like dissemination of Health Alerts.  This site is owned and managed by the Department of State Health Services.</p>
<p>This new portal will be the home of many useful public health applications.  The first application to move to this new portal is the Health Alert Network application.  This is the application that is used to send Health Alerts.  The old portal is still available, as it provides some other functions that have yet to be moved to the new portal.</p>
<p>If you access the old PHIN your account was migrated to the new TxPHIN with your email address as the user ID.  For security purposes, passwords were not migrated, therefore, we ask that users go to "Forgot password" link to request a password reset.  Once you have successfully logged into the application, please visit the "My Account" link at the top right of the screen. Fill in some more information about yourself.</p>
<p>Especially important are the choices of roles and contact devices.  Please browse the list of roles and determine if one or more apply to you.  Roles have a jurisdiction attributes.  By default, your account is marked as "Public" in a certain jurisdiction, which was determined from the records in the old PHIN portal.  The jurisdictional attribute of a role can be "Texas", one of the DSHS Regions, or a county.  At this time, cities and districts are not valid choices for jurisdiction.  So please pick what fits your area of operations best and you may request as many roles as you like.</p>
<p>For each jurisdiction in which you requested a role, an administrator of that jurisdiction will review and approve/deny your request.  You will receive an email when the decision has been made.</p>
<p>Contact devices allow you to receive Health Alerts.  Your account email is your first contact device.  You can add more addresses if you like.  Be sure to add a phone device too.  There are also choices for Blackberry PIN messaging and regular text messaging.  Thanks for your help in bringing the new PHIN Portal online.</p>
