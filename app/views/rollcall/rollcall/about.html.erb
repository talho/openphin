      <p>RollCall is a school surveillance application that will soon be introduced within the new Texas PHIN Portal, <a href="www.txphin.org">www.txphin.org</a>.  The PHIN is supported by robust Health Information Exchange (HIE) technology and is capable of being integrated with the data systems of school districts.  Once the PHIN is gathering data from a school district, health authorities will be able to use the PHIN to analyze and report upon the data collected.  This will provide another surveillance tool for the use of public health.</p>
      <p>The first school district to complete connectivity to the PHIN was Houston ISD.  This connection provides a good example of how future connections should be implemented.  The Houston Department of Health and Human Services contacted the Houston ISD to inquire about gathering absentee data for use in public health surveillance.  The ISD agreed to share this data and set out to determine how the data could be supplied to the health department.  The IT staff at the ISD found that it could automate the process.  An export report was scheduled for a set time of day and programmed to run daily.  This report contains a listing of all schools in the ISD, with their enrollment and absence counts.  This report is transmitted by the automated process to a secure FTP site the PHIN makes available on the internet.  The PHIN picks up the data and processes it, making it available for analysis.</p>
      <p>In addition to the absentee report, a report containing data on all recorded cases of influenza-like illness is transmitted daily.  This report contains the grade and zipcode of the student, as well as their symptoms and what school they attend.  These case reports are entered  by school nurses using the ISD’s web-based school management application.  The ISD had previously decided to track ILI during the H1N1 epidemic this Fall.  Their IT department added a simple web form to their ISD web application to facilitate the recording of these cases.  Now this data is transmitted on a daily basis to the PHIN along with the absentee data.</p>
      <p>It is anticipated that not all school districts will be capable of this type of automated transmission.  Also, most will not have set up a case reporting tool.  The RollCall application will provide a way for this information to be entered.  School nurses can register as users of the PHIN and will be provided with web forms, like the ones employed by Houston ISD , with which to record their data.</p>
      <p>The technical staff at TALHO will be assisting health departments and ISDs throughout the Fall and Spring in using the RollCall system and creating automated linkage to ISD data.  Local health departments are encouraged to negotiate data sharing agreements now in preparation for TALHO’s assistance.  For more information on the use of RollCall, contact Jason Phipps of TALHO at 512-528-9691.</p>
